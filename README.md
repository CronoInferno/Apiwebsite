# Apiwebsite
Currently a prototype project. I started this project to get more familiar with javascript and api's. I also wanted a few merits from school

# Html
This is my first time using bootstrap and overall I've had a good experience with it, although your code can look extremely messy

# Css
Most of the css is handled by bootstrap so that explains that. Most of my css is probably bloated with stuff that doesnt need to be there

# Javascript
Takes a while to get the hang of but w3 helped alot, so did stack overflow, the basics were easy to learn because im pretty experienced in python.
